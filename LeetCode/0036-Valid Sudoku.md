36\. Valid Sudoku

Medium

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

![](../_resources/250px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg_7f5326e4d07d4c90a.png)

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

```

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

**Solution:**
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        cols = collections.defaultdict(set)
        rows = collections.defaultdict(set)
        squares = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                if board[r][c] == ".":
                    continue
                if (board[r][c] in rows[r] or 
                    board[r][c] in cols[c] or
                    board[r][c] in squares[ (r // 3, c // 3) ]):
                    return False 
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                squares[ (r // 3, c // 3) ].add(board[r][c])
        
        return True
```
